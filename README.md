# Speed Typing Test

The **Speed Typing Test** is an interactive web application that allows users to measure their typing speed and accuracy. Users are presented with a random passage of text to type as quickly and accurately as possible within a given time frame. The app calculates and displays the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and the accuracy percentage, offering instant feedback to help users improve their typing skills.

### Features:
- **Typing Speed Measurement**: Calculates the speed in words per minute (WPM).
- **Accuracy Calculation**: Displays the percentage of correct keystrokes.
- **Random Text Passage**: A randomly generated text that users must type to improve their typing speed.
- **Instant Feedback**: Provides real-time feedback on speed and accuracy.
